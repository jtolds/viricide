# viricide

Viricide is an internet-multiplayer-ready version of a famous virus curing puzzle game. 

Slight care has been taken to create a reasonably robust engine such that other
projects can spring from this one. Currently some legacy code exists for the front end
and slightly newer code exists for the server.

Please see [RunningViricide](https://github.com/jtolds/viricide/wiki/RunningViricide) for help on getting started.
